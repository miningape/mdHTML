# mdHTML

## what is this project
this project aims to create "book like" websites based off of md files. For a basic idea of what a "book like" website is check https://book.amethyst.rs/stable/intro.html.

## Reasoning/Motivation
A lot of github projects use md files to help contributors understand what to do, and often use them to also create github wikis. The idea of this project is to create very nice looking wikis for contributors based off the md files already being used. There are a few caveats one of them being if you want a complex (read, headings with subheadings much like the table of contents on wikipedia) they will need to either use json or my own language to affect this.

# Usage
The basic idea is that it generates a table of contents as well as all the webpages, while allowing the user to customize everything, even add for example p5js sketches and other html/js/css extensions/cms to affect the content of the wiki.

This will be done by specifying the file structure as well as the links
